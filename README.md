# Computer-Vision
This repo contains step by step Jupyter notebooks with codes for people that are interested in computer vision. I just completed CV course and along the journey I made these as assignments. Things are easy starting from basic. Also there is not much explanation done as this is more of a pathway rather than tutorial. The only difference is code is written but explanation is not. However, if you look at the result then I am pretty sure you will understand the code and if you don't then raise the issue I will try to add the explanation as well.
- Parts are in series i.e., p0 -> p1 -> p2....
